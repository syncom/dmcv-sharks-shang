# Code of Conduct:

The DMCV Sharks seek to provide a rewarding soccer experience for all players. We
believe that the quality of our Club is measured by the attitude and conduct of its
members, both on and off the field. We believe that how the game is played is more
important than winning. In recognition of these goals and beliefs, the Club has adopted
this Code of Conduct for all players and parents.

## Expectations of Club Players:

teammates, your coach, and the organization. You agree to:

● Avoid inappropriate behavior during practices, games, and team- or
Club-sponsored events.
● Control your emotions during practices and games.
● Attempt to win through skill, effort, and tactics.
● Be fair always, no matter what the outcome will be.
● Take victory modestly and defeat graciously. Adhere to the laws of the game.

## Parents:

your child, his/her teammates, his/her coach, and the organization. You agree to:
● Always remember that the game is for the enjoyment of your child and the other
players.

  ○ Alcohol and drugs (including unauthorized prescription drugs) shall not be
  possessed, consumed, or distributed at any Club practice, game, or other
  Club activity;
  ○ Smoking is not allowed at any Club practice, game, or other Club activity;
  and,
  ○ Dogs are not allowed at any Club practice, game, or other Club activity.

## Referee Abuse:

"Zero Tolerance" Policy for Player and Referee Abuse
The Club’s games are played by youth players, who are learning the skills and tactics of
playing soccer. The Club’s games are often officiated by youth referees, who are
similarly learning the skills and responsibilities of officiating soccer. Just as youth
players will make mistakes during play, youth referees will make mistakes in officiating.
Of primary importance to the DMCV Sharks is the development, enjoyment of the game,
and safety of its youth players and referees. You agree that:
● Verbal abuse of youth players or referees is unacceptable in any situation.
● The Club will not tolerate verbal or non-verbal conduct which questions the
referee’s authority, derides the referee, or criticizes his/her judgment in making or
not making calls during the game.
● The Club has appropriate channels for coaches or parents to share concerns
about officiating— specifically, constructive comments about youth referees
should be directed to the DMCV Sharks office.
● Violation of the Club’s “zero tolerance” policy regarding player and referee abuse
may include sanctions, up to and including, being asked to leave my child’s game
or practice, prohibition from attending future games, or suspension from the Club
with no refund.
